# Road Assist

It is a Android plus Web based project.
Where Citizen of a city can file complain or provide suggestions about the Road and its problems.
And get back response as soon as it is possible.

## How it Works

1. Citizen register themselves and file complain about the road, by sending picture of the incident and location of the incident

2.The complain goes to a government authority on web portal.Where it registers itself under the group of similiar complains.
  The Admin then assigns the complain group to a agent to work upon it.

3. The Agent goes to the site and performs the required action and clicks the photo of the work performed and submits response.

 #### The reponse of the Agent goes to the citizen who registered the relevent complain.
